description: "In an alternate world where the mere presence of American superheroes
changed history, the US won the Vietnam War, Nixon is still president, and the
cold war is in full effect. Watchmen begins as a murder-mystery, but
soon unfolds into a planet-altering conspiracy. As the resolution comes to a
head, the unlikely group of reunited heroes - Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk
Spectre, Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias - have to test the limits of their
convictions and ask themselves where the true line is between good and evil."
